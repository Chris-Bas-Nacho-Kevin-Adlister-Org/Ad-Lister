Ad-Lister is an online C2C marketplace with an emphasis on in-person transactions. Users can view and post ads.

****The marketplace, which has been optimized for smartphones, features large photos of products for sale via an infinite scroll interface. For buyers, products are featured based on the geo-location closest to the buyer to help encourage face-to-face user interactions and encourage community-centric relationships, but can also be filtered by category, price and distance. On the seller side, products are listed immediately by uploading a photo from a user’s smartphone or computer ; the platform makes it easy to sort inbound inquiries by the highest bid before contacting prospective buyers to agree upon price and meeting place.
